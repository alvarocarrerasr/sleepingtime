# Sleeping Cycle Calculator

This is my first project made using Angular 2, which I am currently learning, Ionic Framework and Typescript so as to train my knowledge on that technologies.

I have used the lateral menu template on this project.

## What about sleeping cycles?

Well, you can read more about sleeping cycles on [this website](https://www.sleepcycle.com/how-it-works/).

And finally, the README.md generated by Ionic Framework:


This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start mySideMenu sidemenu
```

Then, to run it, cd into `mySideMenu` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
